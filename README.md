# WAR! 
A simulated version of the card game WAR using JavaScript. If you enjoy it, hit the ‚≠ê  
# Motivation 
I programmed the card game WAR in JavaScript to sharpen my skills in game logic and work with arrays and objects. It was a fun way to practice control flow and simulate real-world game mechanics in code.
# QuickStart 
- Run the project in the code editor / I use Live Server in VScode to run the html on local webpage. 
- When up and running, press the Play button to simulate a card game.
- Inspect the webpage and head over to the console to see game details. 
- You can simulate as many games as you want.
